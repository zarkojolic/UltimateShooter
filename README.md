# Unreal Engine 5 - Third-Person Shooter Gameplay Project

This project is a single-player third-person shooter developed in **Unreal Engine 5**, created as part of a university diploma project. The focus of the project is the implementation of core gameplay systems using **C++** and **Blueprints**, with an emphasis on performance, modularity, and clean gameplay architecture.

## Project Overview
The game features a fully playable third-person character with a complete movement and animation system, a combat system with multiple weapon types, and AI-controlled enemies driven by Behavior Trees. The project demonstrates a hybrid development approach, combining low-level C++ logic with Unreal Engine's visual scripting tools.
